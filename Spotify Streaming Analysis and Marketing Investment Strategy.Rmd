### 1. Overview

**Music streaming platforms are among the best sources of consumer-driven data**, offering detailed insights into user preferences, listening behaviors, and evolving trends. Platforms like Spotify capture a wide range of metrics, including song popularity, a song’s key, genre, tempo, mood, energy, and danceability, making them invaluable for understanding what drives engagement and success in the music industry. By analyzing this data, **companies can develop tailored marketing strategies, optimize playlists, and predict future hits**, ensuring they remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market.

The goal of this project is to explore **how music trends have evolved over time and identify the key factors that contribute to a song's success** in the current market. Additionally, based on the Case Description provided in the Appendix (see 5. Report below), the project builds **a predictive model to identify potential hit songs** and **uses the findings to enhance promotional strategies**. These strategies aim to maximize profitability while minimizing risks associated with promotional investments.

The dataset, Spotify 1, comprises 26,266 entries of historical songs, including both popular and less popular tracks, released before March 2020, offering valuable insights into long-term trends in the music industry.

### 2. Key Findings
This project identified significant trends in the music landscape, key factors influencing hit songs, and strategies for optimizing marketing investments. (Detailed explanations and visualizations are provided in 5. Report below.)

**1) Industry Trends**

  +  Genres such as pop, Latin, and R&B dominate, with Latin music experiencing remarkable growth in recent years, even surpassing rap and pop in some instances. 
  +  Popular songs share distinctive characteristics, including high danceability, energy, and frequent use of major keys like Db/C#, C, and G, which evoke positive and uplifting emotions.
  +  Most successful tracks are studio-produced, feature prominent vocals, and align with modern listening habits, with an average duration of approximately 3:20 minutes. 
  +  Key release months—January, June, and November— were identified as critical periods for maximizing exposure, coinciding with promotional cycles and seasonal engagement. 
  + External factors, such as artist fame, viral trends on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, and collaborations with well-known artists, also play a significant role in boosting song visibility and success. 

**2) Factors **

  +  This analysis shows that the **musical characteristics (instrumentalness, loudness, energy, etc.) and genre are the key drivers of popularity**, while more technical features like tempo, speechiness, liveness, key, and mode have less or no influence.

**3) Marketing Investment Strategy**

  +  As described in the Case Description in the Appendix (in 5. Report below), the predictive model generated an annual **expected payoff of $155,480,000** at a cutoff of 0.22 on testing data.
  + To account for a 20% probability that initially unpopular songs might later gain popularity, an adjustment was made. This increased the **expected payoff to $290,304,000** at a cutoff of 0.10, representing an **improvement of $135,250,000**.
  + This refinement offers a more optimistic forecast by acknowledging delayed success potential and reducing the risk of misclassifying songs as unpopular.
