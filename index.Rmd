📍 Hello, my name is Estelle Cho. 

🎓 Soon to be grad with a M.S. in Business Analytics at the University of Southern California (December 2024).

🌟 **“Data Analyst” “~~~”**

📚 Finished my BA with English Literature and Language, Cultural Contents Convergence studies at ChungAng University (Seoul, Korea)

💻 **Business Analyst at K-POP Entertainment scene**

+ Analyzing marketing data, crafting marketing strategies, and collaborating with global, cross-functional teams to execute campaigns spanning TV shows, media interviews, and outdoor advertisements


📊 **Consultant at Strategy & Management consulting firm**

+ Projects: Post Merger Integration, M&A Advisory, and Commercial & Operational Due Diligence
+ Estimating company valuations, identifying business opportunities, and working closely with internal stakeholders to pinpoint operational bottlenecks and devise effective solutions

💪 I'm driven by an insatiable curiosity. I'm the type of a person who always starts with “Why?” I always ask questions, go deep into the problems, and build solutions by incorporating new ideas. This quality has been fundamental in fostering my analytical thinking, problem-solving, and creative storytelling skills.

🧘️ Hot Yoga Lover! Volleyball, Music Production. Always interested in expanding my sports repertoire!
