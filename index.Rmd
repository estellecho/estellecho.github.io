ðŸŒŸ **My journey has been unique**â€”from English and Cultural Content major, working in Music Entertainment and Business Consulting, to diving into Data Analytics. Looking back, my passion has always been **solving business challenges, analyzing data, and turning insights into visuals and reports that help others understand the story behind the numbers**.

ðŸ“Š As a **Data and Business Analyst**, I analyzed product and platform data, managed dashboards, identified key trends, and developed data-driven strategies. ðŸ’¼ As a **Consultant**, I focused on business valuation and operational improvement by building forecasting models, predictive models, and revenue projections.

ðŸ”¥ Outside of work, I enjoy exploring nature, playing tennis, practicing hot yoga, cooking, making music, and offering life advice to friends and colleagues!
