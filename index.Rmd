📊 As a Data Analyst in E-commerce and a Business Analyst in Entertainment, I managed daily dashboards, identified key trends, and developed data-driven strategies. In Consulting, I built forecasting models, predictive models, and revenue projections to support business decisions. Leveraging Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau, I analyzed diverse datasets to uncover customer insights, evaluate financial metrics, and craft business reports.

🔥 At the heart of what I do is a genuine curiosity—I’m always asking “Why?” This curiosity drives me to understand problems deeply, explore different perspectives, and come up with practical, creative solutions.
