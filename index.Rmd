📊 Across B2C and B2B industries, I have addressed business challenges by analyzing datasets, including financial metrics, social media insights, platform performance, and industry data. As a data analyst in e-commerce and a business analyst in marketing, I <strong>managed daily dashboards, identified key trends, and developed data-driven strategies</strong>. In consulting, I built <strong>forecasting models, predictive models, and revenue projections</strong> to support business decisions. Throughout, I <strong>translated data insights into visuals and reports for non-technical stakeholders</strong>.

🔥 At the heart of what I do is a genuine curiosity—I’m always asking “Why?” This curiosity drives me to understand problems deeply, explore different perspectives, and come up with practical, creative solutions.

🧘️ Hot Yoga, Tennis, Music Production, Life Counseling! Outside of work, you'll find me exploring exciting activities!
