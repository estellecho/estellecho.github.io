🌟 **My journey has been unique**—from English and Cultural Content major, working in Music Entertainment and Business Consulting, to diving into Data Analytics. Looking back, my passion has always been **solving business challenges, analyzing data, and turning insights into visuals and reports that help others understand the story behind the numbers**.

📊 As a **Data and Business Analyst**, I analyzed company and product data, managed dashboards, identified key trends, and developed data-driven strategies. 💼 As a **Data Analytics Consultant**, I interpreted complex datasets, built forecasting and predictive models, and developed revenue projections for business valuations and operational improvements.

🔥 At the heart of what I do is a **genuine curiosity—I’m always asking “Why?”** This curiosity drives me to understand problems deeply, explore different perspectives, and come up with practical, creative solutions. 

👯 I genuinely **enjoy working with people from all walks of life—it’s how I learn, grow, and do my best work**. Some of the most rewarding moments have come from teaming up with talented people to drive the best outcomes and create something great.

🧘️ Outside of work, I enjoy exploring nature, playing tennis, practicing hot yoga, cooking, making music, and offering life advice to friends and colleagues!
