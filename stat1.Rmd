### 1. Overview

As the online world continues to expand, the volume of financial transactions has grown significantly. Credit card transactions, in particular, serve as a rich source of consumer-driven data, offering insights into spending behaviors and uncovering valuable metrics that reveal patterns and trends in financial products.

The primary objectives of this project are:
1. To understand financial transaction trends through statistical analysis and data visualization
2. To build a machine learning model that accurately detects fraudulent activities

The dataset originates from a U.S. government organization in Tennessee, covering real credit card transactions from January to December 2010. It includes 97,852 records with 2,000 manually generated fraud cases for analysis. The variables include transaction amounts, dates, merchant details, cardholder IDs, and fraud labels.

  + LASSO regressions showed the best performance with a cross validation RMSE-score of 0.1121. Although there is a lot of multicollinearity among the variables, LASSO regression include feature selection; it does not select a substantial number of the available variables in its model, as it is supposed to do.
  + The XGBoost model also performs very well with a cross validation RMSE of 0.1162.
  + As those two algorithms are very different, averaging predictions is likely to improve the predictions. As the Lasso cross validated RMSE is better than XGBoost's CV score, I decided to weight the Lasso results double.
