### 1. Overview

The objective of this project is to **analyze property valuation components and their interactions to uncover patterns, understand influencing factors, and investigate potential property tax fraud**. The analysis is based on the New York City Property Valuation and Assessment [Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Property-Valuation-and-Assessment-Data/rgy2-tti8/about_data), provided by the Department of Finance (DOF). This dataset includes approximately 1 million property records, combining categorical and numerical variables. Each record represents a unique property across the city’s five boroughs, offering details such as ownership information, address, market value, assessed tax value, and physical characteristics (e.g., width, depth, number of stories).

### 2. Key Findings

This project uncovered several key insights and patterns that provide a deeper understanding of property valuations and anomaly detection processes. (Specific explanations and details can be found in the 5. Report below.)

**1) Characteristics of the Dataset**

  +  Interactive relationships between variables were leveraged to effectively address missing values. 
  + For instance, Market Value (FULLVAL), Actual Land Value (AVLAND), and Actual Total Value (AVTOT) were filled using a step-by-step approach. The process started with grouping by Tax Class, Borough, and Building Class to calculate average values, followed by broader groupings using Tax Class and Borough, and finally Tax Class alone.
  
**2) Anomaly Detection**

  +  Using advanced analytics techniques, potential anomalies have been identified and assigned fraud scores. Each case requires detailed exploration, with the highest-ranking records analyzed through [visual1](files/(P3) Highest ranking fraud owner.png), [visual2](files/(P3) Heatmap.png) and the [Excel](files/(Project 3) NY_top_lotsize_ne_0.xlsx) file output.
  + For example, LOGAN PROPERTY, INC. (917942) exhibits anomalies in building metrics, with building width and depth recorded as 0, leading to a calculated building volume of 0 despite having 3 stories. Additionally, the market value ($374M) is illogically lower than both the land value ($1.79B) and total value ($4.67B), suggesting potential intentional underreporting to minimize tax liabilities.
